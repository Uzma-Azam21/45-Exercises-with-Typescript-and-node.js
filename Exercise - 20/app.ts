// EXERCISE - 20;

// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Creating a Array of Mountains located in Gigit Baltistan.
let mountains: string[] = ["K2", "Nanga Parbat", "GasherBrum I", "Broad Peak", "Gasherbrum II"];
console.log("List of Mountains located in Gilgit Baltistan:");

// Print the values of Array in the form of List.
mountains.forEach(mountains => console.log(mountains));
