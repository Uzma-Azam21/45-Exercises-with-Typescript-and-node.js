// Exercise 14;
//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
//We're hosting a dinner party, and we'd love for you to be a part of it.
var guestList = ["Fatima", "Rubab", "Alishba", "Kainat", "Iqra"];
guestList.forEach(function (oneGuest) { return console.log("Assalam O Alaikum ".concat(oneGuest, ", We're hosting a dinner party, and we'd love for you to be a part of it.")); });
