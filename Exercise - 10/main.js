// EXERCISE - 10;
// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
// Program 1;
// The below example is stripping names.Stripping names in Typescript typically refers to leading and trailling whitespace characters from a string representing a person's name. This ensure that the name is clean and does not contain any unnecessary spaces.
var personName = "\n\t MIRAL FATIMA \t\n";
console.log(personName);
var stripped = personName.trim();
console.log(stripped);
// Program 2;
// Addition, This calculates the sum of 6 and 2.
console.log(6 + 2);
// Subtraction, This calculates the difference between 16 and 8.
console.log(16 - 8);
// Multiplication, This calculates the product of 2 and 4.
console.log(2 * 4);
// Division, This calculates the result of dividing 32 by 4.
console.log(32 / 4);
